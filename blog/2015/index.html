    </h1>
  


      <p>It's not easy getting into Flux. The diagrams, upper case object keys, the mixins,
and all the terminology. It's powerful, but for someone new to React it's a lot to take in.</p>
<p>Which is fine. Flux is really meant to solve problems for &quot;big&quot; apps.
When your UI is handling multiple events and transforming chunks of data.</p>
<p>In this article we'll explain how we got to using Fynx, and then show some example
code similar to how we used in in our <a href="https://github.com/reapp/hacker-news-app" target="_blank" rel="external">Hacker News app</a>.</p>
<h3>Prelude</h3>
<p>Nowadays, beyond rolling your own, there's a ton of libraries for Flux. From
<a href="http://fluxxor.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Fluxxor</a> to <a href="https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs" target="_blank" rel="external">Reflux</a> to
<a href="https://github.com/acdlite/flummox" target="_blank" rel="external">Flummox</a>, each brings something unique.</p>
<p>At the time we were building our app Fluxxor seemed the best documented and supported.
But, it was still verbose. After a week, out of a desperate want to reduce all the boilerplate
we were writing, we extracted <a href="https://github.com/natew/Brawndo" target="_blank" rel="external">a library on top of it</a>.
It was flexible, and it simplified things. But, now we were stuck with another dependency.</p>
<p>Then, came <a href="https://github.com/foss-haas/fynx" target="_blank" rel="external">Fynx</a>.</p>
<p>See, around the same time as Flux was announced, we'd been reading into <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om" target="_blank" rel="external">Om</a>, <a href="https://github.com/omniscientjs/omniscient" target="_blank" rel="external">Omniscient</a>
and the recently released <a href="https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js" target="_blank" rel="external">Immutable.js</a>.
Immutable structures are awesome, and cursors seemed awesomely simple.
But, you still want to coordinate your actions somehow.</p>
<p>With Fynx, we got just that, and nothing more.
Despite it's awkward ASCII diagram, it actually reduced Flux conceptually to a single thing: actions.
How? Lets take a look.</p>
<h3>Stores</h3>
<p>Well, really just a store. Here's your entire store.js file, with Fynx:</p>
<pre><code>import { createCursorStore } from 'fynx';
import { fromJS } from 'immutable';

module.exports = createCursorStore(fromJS({
  dogIds: [],
  dogs: {}
});
</code></pre>
<p>That's all. Use it's keys as you would normal Flux stores. There's no store methods, no waitFor, just a single cursor.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p>The power of Fynx is in its actions. Our actions.js:</p>
<pre><code>import { createAsyncActions } from 'fynx';

var Actions = createAsyncActions([
  'loadDogs'
]);
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: the async actions in Fynx just means it will chain with promises. It's nice in some cases, but not a requirement.</em></p>
<p>And then, we can make our dogActions.js:</p>
<pre><code>import Actions from './actions';
import store from './store';

// we fetch the ordered array of dogs
// then grab their individual data
Actions.loadDogs.listen(opts =&gt;
  getDogsListFromAPI(opts).then(res =&gt; {
    store().set('dogIds', res);
    getDogsData(res);
  })
)

function getDogsData(res) {
  res.map(id =&gt; {
    getDogAPI(id).then(dog =&gt; {
      store().setIn(['dogs', dog.id], dog)
    })
  })
}

function getDogsListFromAPI() {
  return Promise.resolve([1, 2, 3]);
}

function getDogAPI(id) {
  var data = {
    1: { id: 1, breed: 'Jack Russell' },
    2: { id: 2, breed: 'Shih Tzu' },
    3: { id: 3, breed: 'Pitbull' },
  }
  return Promise.resolve(data[id]);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Some nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>All our dog actions are in one place</li>
<li>I can chain my actions together as much as needed</li>
<li>Simple functions everywhere</li>
</ul>
<h3>Linking it to React</h3>
<p>In our top level Dogs class, lets grab our store and pass it down. We can also grab the store at any level of our app just by importing it.</p>
<pre><code>import store from './store';
import Dog from './Dog';

module.exports = React.createClass({
  render() {
    var dogIds = store().get('dogIds');

    return dogIds.map(id =&gt;
      var dog = store().getIn(['dogs', id]);

      return &lt;Dog data={dog} /&gt;;
    });
  });
});
</code></pre>
<p>And lets say in our Dog component, we can either respond to data simply:</p>
<pre><code>this.props.data.set('name', 'Scruffy');
</code></pre>
<p>And our store will update, along with our UI. But, this isn't Flux. Lets say we add an action in our dogActions file that reverses our dog list. After we've added the action name in our actions.js we can do this:</p>
<pre><code>Action.reverseDogs.listen(() =&gt;
  store().update('dogs', dogs =&gt; dogs.reverse())
);
</code></pre>
<p>And anywhere in our React tree we could then call:</p>
<pre><code>import Actions from './actions';
Actions.reverseDogs();
</code></pre>
<h3>shouldComponentUpdate</h3>
<p>The final step is to optimize our components shouldComponentUpdate now that we have immutable data throughout our app. Omniscient gives us a really nice one that works out of the box with Immutable.js.</p>
<pre><code>import shouldComponentUpdate from 'omniscient/shouldupdate';

React.createClass({
  shouldComponentUpdate,
  render() {
    //...
  }
})
</code></pre>
<p>In <a href="https://reapp.io" target="_blank" rel="external">Reapp</a>, I use <a href="https://github.com/reapp/reapp-component" target="_blank" rel="external">a decorator</a> so I don't have to manually mix it in on every class.</p>

    </h1>
  


      <p>Hybrid apps are in a unique position today. Any developer paying
attention to the drama surrounding them since the iPhone first came out
with web-apps in 2007 (and native in 2008), as read a number of articles
from</p>
<p>Let's take a quick look</p>
<h3>Web Workers and Transferrable Objects</h3>
<p>Our first taste of threading in JS came from Web Workers. They gave us
lightweight threads but with costs. Basically, you can't access the DOM.
But another big downside of using them is that data you send between them
is not shared, it's copied. On mobile, this can mean hundreds of millisecods of
delay when dealing with passing non-trivial amounts of data.</p>
<p>That's where Transferrable Objects come in handy. They are supported by all
modern browsers and you can <a href="http://updates.html5rocks.com/2011/12/Transferable-Objects-Lightning-Fast" target="_blank" rel="external">read more on them in this post</a>.
Basically, they let you pass data by reference (without having to copy it).</p>
<h3>Better parallel JavaScript</h3>
<p>Web Workers with their limitations don't quite get us all the way there.
What we'd have ideally is some form of <a href="https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-immutable-data-structures" target="_blank" rel="external">shared immutable structures</a>.</p>
<p>That, along with another up and comined idea of <a href="">UI Workers</a> would finally
get us to avoid the dreaded slowdowns you see when doing CPU-intensive work
while trying to animate a user interface.</p>
<h3>Apple needs to improve Safari and open iOS to 3rd party browsers</h3>
<p>It's hard to argue that Safari hasn't fallen behind dramatically in the
browser arena as of late. Slow to adopt features have made it a pain for
implementing new technology.</p>
<p>There are some huge bugs in the current WebViews in Safari like JavaScript painting
being delayed during scrolls that prevents proper touch event handling, and
touch inputs being offset completely.</p>
<p>They've been accused of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/12/is-apple-is-using-patents-to-hurt-open-standards/" target="_blank" rel="external">holding back web standards</a>.
Flebox can bring the rendering engine to it's knees, contentEditable, Shadow DOM,
WebRTC don't work properly. <a href="http://timkadlec.com/2015/02/apples-web/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pointer Events</a>
is held up (more reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9106511" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=162757" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>).
Apple even removed support for the High Resolution Time API in 8.1.</p>
<p>Then there's the issues with WebViews on iOS. After years of lagging behind
with a limited non-JIT engine, Apple announced WKWebView's for iOS 8. Finally,
a fast JIT for homescreen/hybrid apps! Only, they never really delivered.</p>
<p>As they stand now there are showstopper bugs that have gone unfixed for three minor
releases. Not only that, but in 8.3, developers are reporting even the speed gains
we desperately needed with WKWebViews have now regressed!</p>
<p>Finally, their developer tools are horribly slow. Debugging a JavaScript app
brings Safari to it's knees, requiring restarts after every Timeline recording
and poor support for Source Maps.</p>
<p>But beyond the feature-set, this all stems from a bigger issue. Browsers need competition.
We need to learn from the history. Competition is necessary, and we don't want another
IE6 nightmare. Let's collectively start pushing apple Apple to open up their
platform. I'm positive the Google and Mozilla teams would be happy to ship their
own engines on iOS, and we'd all be better off for it.</p>
<h3>Native API's should be a priority for browsers</h3>
<p>I'll say something that may not be a very popular opinion: I think Cordova does
an amazing job with their plugin platform. Installing is a breeze, and their goals
of designing upstreamable API's often work very well. The problem is, actually getting
them implemented.</p>
<p>We can hope that ChomeOS (and FirefoxOS) will help in this regard.</p>
<p>One good example is the lack of access for the iOS text selection interface.
Want to react to user selections of text programatically? <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11300590/how-to-captured-selected-text-range-in-ios-after-text-selection-expansion" target="_blank" rel="external">Good luck</a>.</p>
<h3>Gesture interaction needs some love</h3>
<p>This ties into the ongoing Pointer Events controversy,
but the mobile needs better ways of handling gestures and multi-touch interactions.
This could even be as simple as better libraries meant for handling these sort of
things. Things like <a href="http://interactjs.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">interact.js</a> and <a href="http://hammerjs.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">hammer.js</a>
make attempts, and there are rumors that React Native is working on a JS solution
for their own purposes that could be backported to the web.</p>
<h3>All that to say...</h3>
<p>This post may seem like a long rant at the big companies on how they're handling
the web. In my mind, it's impossible to pin a motive on a lot of what they do,
there are certainly people pushing in different directions even the small teams
working on the web at each company.</p>
<p>All this really is, is another attempt to bring more light to the current status.
We all want the web to get better. We want it to be faster, more flexible, and
to be full featured enough to write apps comfortably across all platforms.</p>
