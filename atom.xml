    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Reapp blog.</p>
<p>We've spend a lot of time getting the documentation and presentation of the
website here just right, but it's due time to improve the community. Along
with our own <a href="https://gitter.im/reapp/reapp" target="_blank" rel="external">Gitter channel for chatting</a>
and <a href="https://twitter.com/reapp" target="_blank" rel="external">Twitter account for news</a>,
we're starting this blog.</p>
<p>Reapp is moving at breakneck speed. We have huge ambitions and exciting things
in the pipeline. A Material UI theme is coming. As are new components.</p>
<p>But first, we want to start by
creating the best documentation of any app platform.</p>
<p>Starting this week we'll be publishing a series of articles on using Reapp.
These will be guides on building real-world apps as well as walkthrough on
how to use the more impressive technical features of Reapp.</p>
<p>We already have an exciting full-length walthrough coming out on <a href="http://scotch.io" target="_blank" rel="external">Scotch.io</a>
shortly. We have some great <a href="https://github.com/reapp/hacker-news-app" target="_blank" rel="external">example</a> <a href="https://github.com/reapp/kitchen-sink" target="_blank" rel="external">apps</a>
you can look at for inspiration in structuring your apps.</p>
<p>Finally, we have some big client using Reapp, that will launch their apps in less
time than ever before.</p>
<p>So keep posted here, exciting times are ahead.</p>
